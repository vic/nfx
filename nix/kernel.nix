        Creates an immediate (already resolved) effect.

        An immediate effect is the terminal case of the Fx type - it carries
        both a state and a value, meaning it needs no further context to
        produce its result. This is one of two fundamental constructors for
        the Fx algebraic data type.

        ## Type Signature
        `state -> value -> Fx<state, value>`

        ## Parameters
        - `state`: The current state/context that was used to produce the value
        - `value`: The computed result

        ## Example
        ```nix
        immediate {} 42  # Effect holding value 42 with empty state
        immediate { count = 1; } "done"  # Effect with state and string value
        ```

        - `runFx` - Evaluates an effect to extract its value
      '';
      type = fxImmediate;
      value = state: value: {
        _type = "nfx";
        _tag = "immediate";
        inherit state value;
      };
      tests = {
        "creates immediate fx" = {
          expr = api.types.fxImmediate.check (nfx.immediate { } 42);
          expected = true;
        };
        "stores value" = {
          expr = (nfx.immediate { } 42).value;
          expected = 42;
        };
        "stores state" = {
          expr = (nfx.immediate { x = 1; } 42).state;
          expected = {
            x = 1;
          };
        };
      };
    };

    pending = mk {
      doc = ''
        Creates a pending (suspended) effect awaiting context.

        A pending effect wraps an "ability" - a function that will be called
        given context to produce the next step of computation. This is the
        mechanism by which effects express their requirements: the ability
        requests something from the context.

        ## Type Signature
        `(context -> Fx<S, V>) -> Fx<S, V>`

        ## Parameters
        - `ability`: A function `context -> Fx<S, V>` that consumes context
          and produces the next computation step

        ## Example
        ```nix
        # Effect that reads a number from context and doubles it
        pending (n: immediate n (n * 2))

        # Effect requesting an attribute from context
        pending (ctx: immediate ctx ctx.username)
        ```

        - `adapt` - The fundamental combinator for transforming effects

      type = fxPending;
      value = ability: {
        _type = "nfx";
        _tag = "pending";
        inherit ability;
      };
      tests = {
        "creates pending fx" = {
          expr = api.types.fxPending.check (nfx.pending (_: nfx.immediate { } 1));
          expected = true;
        };
        "stores ability" = {
          expr = builtins.isFunction (nfx.pending (s: nfx.immediate s 1)).ability;
          expected = true;
        };
      };
    };

    runFx = mk {
      doc = ''
        Evaluates an effect to extract its final value.

        This is the interpreter that runs an effect computation. It only works
        when all context requirements have been satisfied (state is unit/empty).
        The function loops until reaching an immediate result, feeding empty
        context `{}` to any pending abilities.

        ## Type Signature
        `Fx<{}, V> -> V`

        ## Parameters
        - `e`: An effect with no remaining context requirements

        ## Returns
        The final computed value

        ## Example
        ```nix
        runFx (pure 42)  # => 42
        runFx (provide 10 (pending (n: immediate n (n * 2))))  # => 20
        ```

        ## Notes
        Before calling runFx, all context requirements must be satisfied using
        `provide` or similar combinators. Calling runFx on an effect that still
        has requirements will fail when the ability tries to access missing context.

        - `pure` - Creates an effect ready for immediate evaluation

      type = fn any;
      value = e: if api.types.fxImmediate.check e then e.value else nfx.runFx (e.ability { });
      tests = {
        "type check" = {
          expr = api.types.fn.check nfx.runFx;
          expected = true;
        };

          expr = nfx.runFx (nfx.immediate { } 42);
          expected = 42;
        };
        "runFx pending calls ability then returns" = {
          expr = nfx.runFx (nfx.pending (_: nfx.immediate { } 99));
          expected = 99;
        };
        "runFx nested pending" = {
          expr = nfx.runFx (nfx.pending (_: nfx.pending (_: nfx.immediate { } 7)));

        };
      };
    };

    adapt = mk {
      doc = ''
        The fundamental combinator - everything else builds on this.

        `adapt` is the core primitive that enables all effect transformations.
        It simultaneously handles:
        1. **Contravariant mapping** of context requirements (what the effect needs)
        2. **Covariant mapping** of continuations (what happens given the result)

        ## Type Signature
        `Fx<S,V> -> (T -> S) -> (T -> S -> V -> Fx<T,U>) -> Fx<T,U>`

        ## Parameters
        - `e`: The effect to transform
        - `cmap`: Context mapper `T -> S` - extracts inner requirement from outer context
        - `fmap`: Continuation `(T, S, V) -> Fx<T,U>` - transforms the result

        ## How It Works
        1. Creates a pending effect expecting context T
        2. Applies `cmap` to get the inner context S
        3. If effect is immediate, applies `fmap` to produce final result
        4. If effect is pending, recursively adapts the continuation

        ## Example
        ```nix
        # Double the result of an effect
        adapt (pure 21) (s: s) (_t: _s: v: immediate {} (v * 2))
        ```
